# Phonebook System (C)
A terminal based phonebook application written in C.
The project focuses on backend-style fundamentals such as data persistence, modular design and file handling.

## Features

- View all contacts
- Delete contacts
- Save contacts to a file

## Tech stack
- C
- Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string,h)

## File structure 
- main.c - program entry point and menu handling
- phonebook.c / phonebook.h - contact logic and data structures
- fileio.c - file input/output operations

## How to Run
-Compile the program using a C- compiler(for example, gcc):

gcc  main.c phonebook.c fileio.c -ophonebook

Then run:
./phonebook
## What I practiced
- Structs and pointers
- File I/O
- Memory management
- Modular program design
